## Samples for SharePoint Saturday Detroit 2017

Included in this repository are samples on basic scenarios leveraging the [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microosft.com). These scenarios covered, include:
* Delegated Authentication
* App-Only Token Authentication
* Getting Users and Groups
* SharePoint basics
* Microsoft Teams intro 

Trying to make these as basic and practical as I as I could, these are created leveraging JavaScript, Node, Angular Cli and PowerShell _(for the App-Only demos)_. Each demo has its *README* file that will provide a walkthrough on that sample.
